A [book](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-haskell) exercise that became a full-blown exploration of Haskell/FP techniques.

## Motivation

Active learning in the wild by coding a Haskell project that converges, piecemeal, pertinent techniques, e.g:
 - Tacit programming
 - Type-level programming
 - Trees that Grow
 - Higher-kinded data
 - Datatype-generic programming
 - GADTs
 - Constraint kinds
 - Constraint dictionaries
 - Singleton types
 - Ghosts of Departed Proofs
 - Deriving strategies
 - Deriving Via
 - Flexible*

<sup>Other alternatives are possible.</sup>

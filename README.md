Today I might feel very differently, but I still very much enjoy:  
&nbsp; combinators, tacit programming, the expression problem, trees that grow, extensible records, property-based testing and benchmarking.


<br>

[cartons](https://github.com/leosbotelho/timeworn/tree/main/cartons) was my bump with [NixOS](https://nixos.org/).

<br>

[blood-transfusion](https://github.com/leosbotelho/timeworn/tree/main/blood-transfusion) readme says it all: _overengineered software, meant as an educational endeavor_.  
&nbsp; Nevertheless, I recommend a peek.

<br>

[rose-tree](https://github.com/leosbotelho/timeworn/tree/main/rose-tree) was also important to me, educationally.

<br>

[hm-lang-light](https://github.com/leosbotelho/timeworn/tree/main/hm-lang-light) and [hm-def-light](https://github.com/leosbotelho/timeworn/tree/main/hm-def-light) highlights are the tests - and some weird tacit programming

<br>

[tsuru-capital-code-sample](https://github.com/leosbotelho/timeworn/tree/main/tsuru-capital-code-sample) is ok; but I'd have written it in boring and faster haskell today.  
- I used:
    - [conduit](https://github.com/snoyberg/conduit#readme)
    - extensible records with [vinyl](https://github.com/VinylRecords/Vinyl)
    - refinement types with [refined](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/refined)
    - money with [safe-money](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/safe-money)
    - [etc](https://github.com/leosbotelho/timeworn/blob/main/tsuru-capital-code-sample/tsuru-capital-code-sample.cabal#L19)
- Property-based testing and benchmarking with [Quickcheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck); see [test](https://github.com/leosbotelho/timeworn/blob/main/tsuru-capital-code-sample/src/Test.hs) and [bench](https://github.com/leosbotelho/timeworn/blob/main/tsuru-capital-code-sample/src/Bench.hs).
